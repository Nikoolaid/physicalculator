A common example in our physics class is <b>gravitational kinetic energy</b>, which is the amount of kinetic energy something would have if it were released and allowed to fall freely. Gravitational potential energy is proportional to the object's mass, gravitational acceleration, and height above the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n        <Equation equation=\"e = m*g*h\" />\r\n\r\n        <p>Now let's say we lift something up, and then drop it. In a theoretically perfect world, every single iota of the potential energy would be converted into kinetic energy. However, this isn't always the case. If it falls <i>really</i> far it almost definitely won't be the same, since the air resistance slows it down.
